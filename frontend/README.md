# Conversation canvas and development workspace

The workspace lives in `dashboard.py` and the developer console in `dev.py`,
following the repository's `.py` source convention. FastAPI serves the canvas at `/` and development tools at
`/dev`. Both call the same-origin API; no frontend framework or build is needed.

From the repository root:

```sh
uv sync
uv run alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
uv run second-brain
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/`. Restart an existing server after updating Python
routes or backend code. UI asset edits appear on page reload. For automatic
backend reload, use `uv run uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --port 8000`.

## Main journey

1. Start with the workspace canvas on the left and Muse chat on the right, even
   when no tasks exist. No task form is required.
2. Answer clarifying questions or review the task objects and steps Muse proposes.
3. Revise through chat or edit proposed titles, descriptions, and deadlines directly.
   You can remove unwanted tasks or steps. Follow-up messages carry unsaved edits.
4. Save the reviewed plan. Persisted task objects become cards on the canvas.
5. Edit saved tasks, choose among five importance levels, or mark work complete.
6. Return to saved tasks and conversation history. Demo login stays connected for
   eight hours across both pages and reloads; Sign out ends this browser session.

Model proposals remain separate from saved work until accepted. Conversation
corrections can update existing task objects; steps append to existing plans.
The model can correct an existing step by ID. The UI renders fixed task components,
not generated HTML or arbitrary widgets. See `API_CONTRACT.md` for object shapes.

## Development tools

`/dev` is a read-only diagnostic console rather than a second task-editing UI:

- Snapshot counts, configured model, account, access mode, and service liveness.
- Filterable model runs with actual input, review drafts, proposals, errors,
  timestamps, related messages, and linked events.
- Searchable saved tasks, context, and messages, with field and JSON inspectors.
- Searchable change history and the full account snapshot.
- Manual refresh and optional ten-second refresh while the page is visible.

Proposals are reviewed on the workspace. The console labels pending changes,
stale data after a connection failure, and the limits of health/timing information.
Snapshot fetch timing is measured in the browser; provider latency and token usage
are not recorded. There are no task/context mutation controls in the dev console;
existing backend editing endpoints remain accessible through the API reference.

There are no seeded objects or simulated model responses in either page. The
Meta key stays server-side. The demo token is exchanged for an eight-hour signed HttpOnly session cookie;
it is not saved in JavaScript storage. Both pages share the session and clear
private rendered state when access expires. Sign-out also discards unsaved edits. Browser drafts
survive in-page request failures, but unsaved edits are not persisted across
navigation or reload. A network retry reuses its request ID and input. Voice,
automatic onboarding extraction, real sign-in, arbitrary widgets, and task
execution remain incomplete.

## Verification

October 26, 2026: browser checks used an isolated SQLite database and real Muse
Spark. Chat created a two-step homework proposal, a follow-up revised that plan,
and a direct edit was saved before approval. The canvas displayed saved objects
and completion updates. Saved edits and completion survived reload; a rename
proposal updated the same task, and the `/dev` inspector showed those records.
A stopped-server check preserved the chat draft and saved cards. Automated fixture tests cover creation, revisions,
clarifying replies, invalid model output, retries, preservation of corrections,
owner isolation, stale proposals, and upgrading existing task-planning data.
Hosted deployment and Neon are not verified by these checks.

The narrow mobile layout is included in CSS but has not been visually verified.

October 27, 2026 refinement: session tests cover page navigation/reload, expiry,
tampering, token rotation, owner binding, HTTPS cookie flags, explicit cross-origin
write rejection, and sign-out. Desktop Safari checks verified the stable empty
layout and workspace → dev → workspace navigation without reconnecting.
Browser checks also traced a real Muse proposal through the console, recorded input,
approval, saved task objects, and linked events. Reload remained authenticated;
sign-out cleared private state and browser Back required login again. These checks
used an isolated local SQLite database, not deployed Neon.
